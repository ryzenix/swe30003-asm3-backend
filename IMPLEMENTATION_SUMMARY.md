# Implementation Summary: Product Image Array Support

## Overview
Successfully updated the products-related endpoints to support the new image array field from PostgreSQL and added S3 image upload functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies Added
- `@aws-sdk/client-s3`: AWS S3 client for file uploads
- `@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner`: For generating signed URLs
- `multer`: For handling multipart form data (file uploads)

### 2. New Files Created

#### `src/core/S3Service.js`
- Handles S3 image upload, deletion, and URL management
- Supports file upload with automatic naming
- Includes error handling and logging
- Provides methods for extracting S3 keys from URLs

#### `IMAGE_UPLOAD_GUIDE.md`
- Comprehensive documentation for the new image upload functionality
- Includes API endpoint documentation
- Provides setup instructions and examples

### 3. Updated Files

#### `package.json`
- Added new AWS SDK and multer dependencies

#### `src/models/Product.js`
- Updated all database queries to support `images` array and `main_image_index`
- Modified create, update, getById, and list methods
- Removed old `image` field references
- Added support for image array operations

#### `src/controllers/ProductController.js`
- Added S3Service integration
- New methods:
  - `uploadImage()`: Upload images to S3 and update product
  - `deleteImage()`: Delete images from S3 and update product
  - `setMainImage()`: Set main image index
- Comprehensive error handling for all image operations

#### `src/routes/ProductRoutes.js`
- Added multer configuration for file uploads
- New routes:
  - `POST /:productId/images/upload`: Upload new image
  - `DELETE /:productId/images/:imageIndex`: Delete specific image
  - `PUT /:productId/images/:imageIndex/main`: Set main image
- File validation (5MB limit, image types only)
- Authentication required for all image operations

## Database Schema Support

The implementation supports the PostgreSQL schema changes:
```sql
images text[] DEFAULT '{}'::text[],
main_image_index integer DEFAULT 0
```

## API Endpoints

### New Image Management Endpoints:
1. **Upload Image**: `POST /products/:productId/images/upload`
2. **Delete Image**: `DELETE /products/:productId/images/:imageIndex`
3. **Set Main Image**: `PUT /products/:productId/images/:imageIndex/main`

### Updated Product Endpoints:
- All existing product endpoints now support `images` and `mainImageIndex` fields
- Product responses include image array and main image index

## Features Implemented

### Image Upload
- S3 integration with automatic file naming
- File type validation (jpg, jpeg, png, gif, webp)
- File size limits (5MB)
- Automatic product update with new image URLs

### Image Management
- Delete specific images by index
- Set main image for product display
- Automatic main image index adjustment when images are deleted
- S3 cleanup when images are deleted

### Security
- Authentication required for all image operations
- File type validation prevents malicious uploads
- Proper error handling and logging

## Environment Configuration Required

Add to `.env` file:
```env
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key_id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_access_key
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-s3-bucket-name
```

## Next Steps

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Configure AWS S3 credentials in `.env`
3. Set up S3 bucket with appropriate CORS settings
4. Test the new endpoints with image uploads

## Testing

The implementation is ready for testing with the following endpoints:
- Create/update products with image arrays
- Upload images via multipart form data
- Delete specific images
- Set main images
- Retrieve products with image arrays

All endpoints include proper error handling and validation.
